# clarey:bit

### A micro:bit project made with love. ❤️

## About
clarey:bit is a MSITAU project mainly worked on by me. (SimiPers)

Every design or image that i have made is inspired by the micro:bit brand and logos, I am NOT associated with the Micro:bit Educational Foundation.
This project is only usable on the micro:bit V2, the project uses the data logger extension, a block that enables the built-in speaker, an action that requires the logo to be pressed.

## Features

All images provided here is taken from the Microsoft MakeCode for micro:bit, i simply don't own a micro:bit. (Yes, i'm crazy.)

### Thermometer

Wanted to see how warm or cold it is by just 3 images?
**Shake.**
***Shake the micro:bit.***
***Shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky, shaky :)***

### Record-And-Playback

![Record-And-Playback](record.png)

By pressing onto P1, you can start recording!
After pressing P2, you will hear what you said.
Recordings will not save onto the device in any way. (Atleast, i think.)
