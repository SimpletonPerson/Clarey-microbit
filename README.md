# clarey:bit

### A micro:bit project made with love. ❤️

## About
clarey:bit is a MSITAU project mainly worked on by me. (SimiPers)

Every design or image that i have made is inspired by the micro:bit brand and logos, I am NOT associated with the Micro:bit Educational Foundation.
This project is only usable on the micro:bit V2, the project uses the data logger extension, a block that enables the built-in speaker, an action that requires the logo to be pressed.

## Features

All images provided here is taken from the Microsoft MakeCode for micro:bit, i simply don't own a micro:bit. (Yes, i'm crazy.)
